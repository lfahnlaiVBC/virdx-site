			'Our *in vivo* spatial microscopy platform combines a cutting-edge biophysical simulation platform, customized MRI protocols, and a rigorous, clinically-validated ground truth framework to generate pioneering synthetic histology.',
			'**Next-Generation MRI sensing**: Proprietary MRI protocols are optimized for machine learning and engineered for broad compatibility, allowing the vast network of existing MRI scanners to be upgraded into real-world histological sensors.',
			'**Biophysical simulation platform**: Groundbreaking biophysical models simulate the distinct MRI profiles of different tissues. Diffusion-aware classifier models resolve MRI signatures into detailed tissue maps that reveal salient histological features at the mesoscopic scale.',
			'**Integrated Ground Truth Framework**: Fusing 3D bioengineering and next-generation computational registration, our patented ground truth pipeline achieves superior model accuracy and reliability by ensuring perfect spatial alignment between histopathology and MRI datasets.'
